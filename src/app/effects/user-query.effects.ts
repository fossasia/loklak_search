/**
 * Effects offer a way to isolate and easily test side-effects within your
 * application. StateUpdates is an observable of the latest state and
 * dispatched action. The `toPayload` helper function returns just
 * the payload of the currently dispatched action, useful in
 * instances where the current state is not necessary.
 *
 * A simple way to think of it is that ngrx/effects is an event listener of sorts.
 * It listens for actions being dispatched to the store. You can then tell `ngrx/effects`
 * that when a particular action is dispatched, to take another, new action as a result.
 * At the end, whatâ€™s really happening is `ngrx/effects` is an `action generator` that dispatches
 * a `new action` as a result of a different action.

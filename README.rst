The loklak_search creates a website using the loklak server as a data source.
The goal is to get a search site, that offers timeline search as well as
custom media search, account and geolocation search.

In order to run the service you can use the API of http://api.loklak.org or
install your own loklak server data storage engine. loklak_server_ is a server
application which collects messages from various social media tweet sources,
including twitter. The server contains a search index and a peer-to-peer
index sharing interface. All messages are stored in an elasticsearch index.

The site of this repo is deployed on the GitHub gh-pages branch and automatically
deployed here: http://loklak.org

The loklak_search creates a website using the loklak server as a data source. The goal is to get a search site, that offers timeline search as well as custom media search, account and geolocation search.

In order to run the service you can use the API of http://api.loklak.org or install your own loklak server data storage engine. [loklak_server](https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server) is a server application which collects messages from various social media tweet sources, including twitter. The server contains a search index and a peer-to-peer index sharing interface. All messages are stored in an elasticsearch index. but this will help in overcoming the issues emerged by elasticsearch. 

The site of this repo is deployed on the GitHub gh-pages branch and automatically deployed here: http://loklak.org

## Technology Stack
##### Components
* HTML - Structure of the web page generated.
* CSS - Styling options and details of the web page.
* JavaScript(JSON) - Used to store information for deploying the application such as dependencies.
* Angular2 - Structure for deployment of the web page.

## Services and Dependencies
* Bower - The goal is to use [Bower](http://bower.io) to manage front-end dependencies in future.

## Requirements
* [Angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation)
* node --version >= 6
* npm --version >= 3

## Installation
First we will need to install angular-cli by using the following command:
```sh
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```
After installing angular-cli we need to install our required node modules, so we will do that by using the following command:
```sh
$ npm install
```
## How to deploy?
### Running on localhost:
* **Step 1:** Fork loklak_search repository and clone it to your desktop
* **Step 2:** Then cd into that cloned folder
* **Step 3:** Deploy locally by running this :```$ ng serve```

#### How to use ngrx/StoreDevtools?
* **Step 1:** Install the `Redux Devtools` [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en-US).
* **Step 2:** We don't enable the ReduxDevtools by default due to performance considerations. To enable this, un-comment the *StoreDevtools* `import` in `app.module.ts`.

**Note:** Please make sure that you comment the *StoreDevtools* `import` again before making the PR.

### For deploying with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/):
With these very simple steps you can have loklak_search deployed:
* **Step 1:** Fork loklak_search repository and clone it to your desktop
* **Step 2:** Then checkout to your master branch `$ git checkout master`
* **Step 3:** Deploy running this : ```$ npm run deploy```
* **Step 4:** Visit `https://yourusername.github.io/loklak_search` and you should see the search running
* **Step 5:** As you search you might see that it can't find anything, to resolve this, on search you will see there is a red shield on search bar, click on it and allow to load scripts
* **Step 6:** Reload and you will have a function loklak search page deployed with github pages.

### Loklak Server

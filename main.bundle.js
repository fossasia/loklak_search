We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.\n        <br><br>\n        Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law.

This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mea.n that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.\n        <br><br>\n        In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.\n        <br><br>\n        Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.\n        <br><br>\n        </p>\n    <h2>Your loklak Account</h2>\n        <p>\n        You may need a loklak Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own loklak Account, or your loklak Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a loklak Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.\n        <br><br>\n        To protect your loklak Account, keep your password confidential.

You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.\n        <br><br>\n        When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give loklak (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to loklak Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant this license for any content that you submit to our Services.\n        <br><br>\n        If you have a loklak Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on loklak or on third-party applications connected to your loklak Account in our Services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts.

This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by loklak, in the manner permitted by these terms.\n        <br><br>\n        Most of our services are offered through Free Software and/or Open Source Software.

We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.\n        <br><br>\n        You can stop using our Services at any time. loklak may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.\n        <br><br>\n        We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service.\n        <br><br>\n        </p>\n    <h2>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>\n        <p>We provide our Services using a reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them.

For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.\n         <br><br>\n        Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.\n        <br><br>\n        </p>\n    <h2>Liability for our Services</h2>\n        <p>When permitted by law, loklak, and loklak’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.\n        <br><br>\n        To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of loklak, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).\n        <br><br>\n        In all cases, loklak, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.\n        <br><br>\n        We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the Services for a personal purpose, then nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal rights which may not be waived by contract.\n        <br><br>\n        </p>\n    <h2>Business uses of our Services</h2>\n        <p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify loklak and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.\n        <br><br>\n    <h2>About these Terms</h2>\n        <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.\n        <br><br>\n        If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.\n        <br>\n        These terms control the relationship between loklak and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.\n        <br><br>\n        If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).\n        <br><br>\n        If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.<br><br>\n\n        You agree that the laws of Can Tho, Viet Nam will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the services will be litigated exclusively in the courts of Can Tho City, Viet Nam, and you and loklak consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.\n        <br><br>\n        For information about how to contact loklak, please visit our contact page.\n        <br><br>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <app-footer></app-footer>\n"

/**
 * Effects offer a way to isolate and easily test side-effects within your
 * application. StateUpdates is an observable of the latest state and
 * dispatched action. The `toPayload` helper function returns just
 * the payload of the currently dispatched action, useful in
 * instances where the current state is not necessary.
 *
 * A simple way to think of it is that ngrx/effects is an event listener of sorts.
 * It listens for actions being dispatched to the store. You can then tell `ngrx/effects`
 * that when a particular action is dispatched, to take another, new action as a result.
 * At the end, what’s really happening is `ngrx/effects` is an `action generator` that dispatches
 * a `new action` as a result of a different action.
